# Founders’ Bench – Minimal Site

A clean, minimal, single-page site for **Founders’ Bench** — a closed, curated room where service founders in Hyderabad work through real business problems together.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Main single-page layout with sections:
  - Hero
  - How it works
  - Who it’s for / not for
  - Why Founders’ Bench exists
  - Request an invite (application form)
- `styles.css` – Neutral, editorial-inspired styling (no stock photos, plenty of whitespace).
- `script.js` – Small enhancements: smooth scrolling for in-page links and simple client-side validation + acknowledgement for the form.

## Running the site

This is a static site. You can:

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (for example, using VS Code / Cursor’s “Live Server” extensions or a simple Node/ Python HTTP server).
