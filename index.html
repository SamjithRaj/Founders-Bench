              Founders’ Bench is a 90‑minute, invite‑only working session where
              8–10 service founders each bring one live business problem and
              work it through with peers at a similar stage. No panels, no
              keynotes, no pitching—just focused, honest problem‑solving.

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
              A simple, disciplined format so the 90 minutes are calm, direct,
              and useful.

              <h3>Small, steady room</h3>
              <p>
                Each Bench is 8–10 founders running service businesses in the
                ₹3–25L/month range. The room is kept small so everyone has
                space, and the mix is deliberate so conversations stay relevant.

            <div class="column">
              <h3>Pre‑submitted problems</h3>
              <p>
                Before each session, you share one specific problem—hiring, lead
                quality, margins, delivery, operations, or anything else that is
                blocking progress. Vague topics and generic “brainstorming” are
                filtered out.

              <h3>Moderated, time‑boxed discussion</h3>
              <p>
                A moderator keeps the session grounded. Each problem gets a set
                amount of time. The goal is not to impress the room, but to
                unpack the real constraints and options in front of you.

                You leave with 2–3 clear actions you can take in the next
                1–4 weeks—not a 50‑point wishlist. At the next Bench, you’re
                expected to report back on what you tried and what changed.

              <p>
                Running a services business is often lonely. Most days are spent
                between clients, team, and numbers—with very few people who
                actually understand the mix of delivery, cash flow, hiring, and
                sales you’re juggling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generic founder groups are either too early, too large, or too
                polite to be useful. Panels and keynotes don’t help when
                you’re facing a specific, immediate decision about a person, a
                client, or a contract.

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Founders’ Bench exists to create a room where serious service
                founders can talk plainly about what is actually happening in
                their businesses—without posturing, without selling, and
                without being “on stage”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The focus is on outcomes: a smaller set of better decisions over
                time, made with the benefit of peers who have seen similar
                situations before. Trust and relevance matter more than volume.
